# Lexical Analyzer using flex

## Overview
Builds off of the previous assignment. Utilizes a scanner written in flex to scan the tokens of the input file (such as special operation symbols and reserved words) to generate a token file output such that each token is printed alongside its location (line number and file), the name of the token determined by get_yytname, and the lexical information of the token.
