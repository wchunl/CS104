# LALR(1) Parser using bison

## Overview
Builds off of the previous assignment. A parser is added to the compiler project which parses the grammar of the custom language used in the class. The parser generates an abstract syntax tree which stores the tokens of the input file in a tree format and includes the following grammar definitions:

- Structures
- Identifiers
- Types
- Expressions
- Operators (Unary, Binary, Variadic, Allocators, Parentheses)
- Statement Keywords (while, if-else, return, blocks, semicolons, expressions, variable declarations)
- Function Definitions

The abstract syntax tree is printed in readable format to an output file.
